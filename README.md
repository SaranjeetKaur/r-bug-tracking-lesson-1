This lesson introduces the bug tracking process used by [the R project][r].
It is intended for people that are completely new to this topic, 
to help them understand ways in which they can contribute. 
Although it is aimed at R users, it may be of interest to potential contributors to other software projects that use [Bugzilla][bugzilla].

The lesson was originally delivered as two [Collaboration Campfire][campfire] sessions.
We hope that this material will be helpful for people that would like to 
run a similar session in future, or potential contributors that would like to
go through the material themselves.

## Acknowledgements

This lesson uses the website [template][template] from [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench], which is 
Copyright Â© [Software Carpentry][swc-site] 
under a [CC BY 4.0][cc-by-human] license. We have made changes to reflect that this is a R Contribution Working Group project, rather than a Carpentries project.

The Collaboration Campfires were organized as part of the project [Building Community around the R Development Guide](https://incubator.codeforscience.org/cohort), lead by Saranjeet Kaur and Heather Turner, which was supported by the Digital Infrastructure Incubator at [Code for Science & Society (CS&S)](https://codeforscience.org/). The project benefited from the input of community champions from groups such as R-Ladies and members of the R Contribution Working Group.

The first draft of this lesson was developed on the Hack Day as part of 
[Collaborations Workshop 2022](https://software.ac.uk/cw22).
